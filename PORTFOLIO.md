### Absolute Stone Design (ASD)

**Multi‑Role Operations Platform**

![ASD App](assets/images/app_store/asd-app.png)

Absolute Stone Design (ASD) is a production‑ready, multi‑role operations platform built for a real stone fabrication and installation business. The product replaces fragmented workflows such as phone calls, text messages, spreadsheets, and disconnected tools with a single, unified system supporting Admins, Sales Representatives, Schedulers, Installers, and Clients. 

**Owned end‑to‑end:** strategy, UX/UI, design system, AI governance, and cross‑platform delivery on iOS, Android, and Web.

#### Problem Statement

Operational workflows were fragmented and inefficient:
- Clients lacked visibility into job status and timelines
- Installers relied on informal communication and manual updates
- Sales and scheduling were disconnected from execution
- Admins lacked centralized control and system governance

This resulted in high coordination overhead, inconsistent client experience, and limited scalability.

**Goal:** Design and ship a single, scalable platform that:
- Unifies operations across all roles
- Reduces manual coordination and cognitive load
- Improves transparency and client trust
- Enables AI adoption with clear human oversight

#### Users & Roles

- **Admin**: Full system governance, role promotion, content control, and AI oversight
- **Sales Representative**: Lead management, contracts, and client communication
- **Scheduler**: Job scheduling and coordination across teams
- **Installer**: Field execution, live location tracking, and job lifecycle
- **Client**: Discovery, order tracking, communication, and transparency

#### Product Strategy

- Single authentication flow for all users
- Dynamic role‑based routing after login
- Progressive disclosure to reduce cognitive overload
- Admin positioned as a central control layer, not a bottleneck
- AI designed as a governed assistant, not an autonomous system

#### Design System

Token-based design system shared across mobile and web, ensuring consistency and scalability.
