# Testing Liquid Glass Packages

Let's test different liquid glass packages one by one to find the most realistic one.

## Available Packages to Test

1. **liquid_glass_effect** - UI components with liquid glass effects
2. **oc_liquid_glass** - Realistic refraction, blur, and lighting (GPU-accelerated)
3. **liquid_glass_animation** - Animated glass UI effects
4. **Liquido** - Experimental, requires Impeller

## Testing Approach

We'll test each package by:
1. Adding it to `pubspec.yaml`
2. Creating a test implementation
3. Comparing the visual result
4. Keeping the one that looks most realistic
