# Checking liquid_glass_effect Package API

The package has been added successfully. To use it for the "We design and build" text, we need to:

1. Check the package documentation on pub.dev
2. See what widgets/classes it exports
3. Implement accordingly

**Next Steps:**
- Run the app and check for any import errors
- Check pub.dev page for `liquid_glass_effect` to see usage examples
- Or try common widget names like `GlassText`, `LiquidGlass`, `GlassCard`, etc.

**Current Status:**
- Package added: `liquid_glass_effect: ^1.0.1`
- Import added but not yet used
- Need to check package API to implement properly

**Alternative:**
If this package doesn't work well, we can test the next package: `oc_liquid_glass`
